3.2 Single Layer Perceptron

insufficient justification in "neurals are learning the digit", since this is also the case for multilayer perceptrons and pretty much every other type of ml model which may not exhibit these patterns in a layer's weights. also looking for additional reasoning along the lines of dot products producing higher activations when the vectors are more aligned
